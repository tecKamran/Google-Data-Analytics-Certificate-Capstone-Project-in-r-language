# Google-Data-Analytics-Certificate-Capstone-Project-in-r-language
This repository showcases the culminating project from the Google Data Analytics Certificate. Completed in 2025, the assignment invited us to choose one of three available case studies. I opted for the Divvy Bikes scenario as my focus.

The analysis was conducted on Kaggle, combining both Microsoft Excel and R. The project workflow included:

Data Cleaning: Evaluating and improving data quality, organizing and merging datasets, and creating new variables.

Exploration & Visualization: Identifying trends in Divvy bike usage and crafting visual representations like charts and plots.

Forward-Looking Insights: Offering recommendations to inform future analyses and drive strategic decision-making.
